TIME COMPLEXITY
    The time complexity of an algorithm is the total amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its execution. 
    'O' - Worst case run time
    'Ω' - Best case run time

    Types of time complexity:
        1) O(1) — Constant Time
            Constant time means the running time is constant, it’s not affected by the input size.
        2) O(n) — Linear Time
            When an algorithm accepts n input size, it would perform n operations as well.
        3) O(log n) — Logarithmic Time
            Algorithm that has running time O(log n) is slight faster than O(n). 
            Commonly, algorithm divides the problem into sub problems with the same size. 
            Example: binary search algorithm, binary conversion algorithm.
        O(n log n) — Linearithmic Time
            This running time is often found in “divide & conquer algorithms”. They d
            ivide the problem into sub problems recursively and then merge them in n time. 
            Example: Merge Sort algorithm.
        5) O(n²) — Quadratic Time
            Loop inside a loop.
        6) O(n³) — Cubic Time
        7) O(2^n) — Exponential Time
        8) O(n!) —Factorial Time
            Its the slowest of them all.
