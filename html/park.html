      While there are many plants growing in the wild,<br>
       people also cultivate and grow certain plants, <br>
       bushes and shrubs in their homes or yards.
      <br>
       This activity is known as gardening.<br>
        While it may appear as a hobby to some, <br>
        the fact is that gardening is actually quite beneficial and,<br>
         therefore, important to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardening is a fairly physical activity. <br>
      It involves weeding, watering of plants, mulching, <br>
      trellising and harvesting â€“ all of which require<br>
       physical labour from the gardener. 
      <br> Hence, it becomes an excellent addition<br>
       to your exercise routine.
